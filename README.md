## Natural Language Processing for PDF, TIFF, and camera captured documents.

### Framework

The Epipog NLP framework provides an easy to get started into the world of machine learning for your unstructured data in PDF documents, scanned documents, TIFF facsimiles and camera captured documents. 

  - Automatic OCR of scanned and camera captured images.
  - Automatic Text Extraction from documents.
  - Automatic Syntax Analysis.
  - Programmatic control for data extraction or redaction (de-identification)
  
    - Names, Addresses, Proper Places
    - Social Security Numbers, Data of Birth, Gender
    - Telephone Numbers
    - Numerical Information (e.g., medical, financial, â€¦) and units of measurement.
    - Unit conversion from US Standard to Metric, and vice-versa
    - Unicode character recognition

  - Machine Training of Document and Page Classification.
  
The framework consists of a sequence of Python modules which can be retrofitted into a variety of configurations. The framework is designed to fit seamlessly and scale with an accompanying infrastructure. To achieve this, the design incorporates:

  - Problem and Modular Decomposition utilizing Object Oriented Programming Principles.
  - Isolation of Operations and Parallel Execution utilizing Functional Programming Principles.
  - High Performance utilizing Performance Optimized Python Structures and Libraries.
  - High Reliability and Accuracy using Test Driven Development Methodology.

## Audience

This framework is ideal for any organization planning to do data extraction from their repository of documents into an RDBMS system for CART analysis, linear/logistic regressions or generating word vectors for natural language deep learning (DeepNLP).
