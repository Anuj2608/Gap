## The First Steps in using Gap for Computer Vision (CV)

The first step in using Gap for machine learning (ML) of computer vision (CV) is learning to classify a single object in an image.
Is it a dog, a cat, what digit is it, what sign language digit is it, etc...

To do single object classification, depending on the images, one will use either a artificial neural network 
([ANN](https://github.com/andrewferlitsch/Training/blob/master/AITraining/Fundamentals/Machine%20Learning/ML%20Neural%20Networks.pptx)) 
or a convolutional neural network ([CNN](https://github.com/andrewferlitsch/Training/blob/master/AITraining/Fundamentals/Machine%20Learning/ML%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.pptx)).
